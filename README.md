# Predictive Analysis on Heart Diseases

## Problem Statement
* Heart Disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and preventive measures.
* The objective of this project is to develop machine learning model that an effecively predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

## Objective
* The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease.
* By analysing a comprehensive set of patient attributes, including demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors, the model aims to identify patterns and features indicative of the presence or absence of heart disease.
