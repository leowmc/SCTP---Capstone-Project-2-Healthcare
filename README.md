# Predictive Analysis on Heart Diseases

## Problem Statement
* Heart Disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and preventive measures.
* The objective of this project is to develop machine learning model that an effecively predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

## Objective
* The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease.
* By analysing a comprehensive set of patient attributes, including demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors, the model aims to identify patterns and features indicative of the presence or absence of heart disease.

* Heart disease shows positive correlation with ap_hi, ap_lo, cholesterol, weight and current_age.

## Data Modelling
* We will compare the accuracy from the following models to decide which one performs best and the best performng model will be selected to determine the presence or absence of heart disease.
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - k-Neighbors Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Support Vector Classifier
